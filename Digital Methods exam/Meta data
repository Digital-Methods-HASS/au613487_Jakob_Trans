The data was created by OECD
The data file contains information about contries and their GDP per capita

"Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard measure of the value added created through the
production of goods and services in a country during a certain period. As such, it also measures the
income earned from that production, or the total amount spent on final goods and services (less
imports). While GDP is the single most important indicator to capture economic activity, it falls short of
providing a suitable measure of people's material well-being for which alternative indicators may be
more appropriate. This indicator is based on nominal GDP (also called GDP at current prices or GDP in
value) and is available in different measures: US dollars and US dollars per capita (current PPPs). All OECD
countries compile their data according to the 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA). This indicator is
less suited for comparisons over time, as developments are not only caused by real growth, but also by
changes in prices and PPPs."

The data was created during the period 1960-2019
